# Shadercleanup:
#   -> For now I will leave the shitty push! robj + pipeline situation as it is
#      to later implement a better way, redoing all the visualizes into also
#      returning what pipeline.
#   -> Reason why shader for heatmap doesn't compile is that it can't find certain things in the data!
#
# Renderingcleanup:
#   -> Right now the way that the screenbuffer is displayed to the plot window
#      requires there to be at least one pipeline is inside the pipelines of the Screen.
#      This should probably change.
#
# VertexArraycleanup:
#   -> Instancing is now done the other way around to what it should be.
#
#
#
# generalcleanup:
#   -> Put finalizer(free) for all the GLobjects!
#   -> So many speedups possible!
#
# What doesn't work:
#   -> poly colormap
