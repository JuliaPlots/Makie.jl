# Summary

Makie.jl is a high-performance, extendable, and multi-platform plotting package for Julia.
It takes advantage of Julia's multiple-dispatch features to provide multiple backends, including
OpenGL, WebGL and Cairo.  

While it offers a high-level interface, unlike many other plotting packages, Makie also has a lower-level interface, 
which can be used to create complex and customized visualizations with ease.

# Architecture

- Describe the recipe system, which allows very easy extension from arbitrary user packages, with a lightweight dependency.
- Describe the separation of backends and AbstractPlotting


# Citations

# Figures
